# C_Programming_Files

This repo and these C programming files are related my Scientific Programming in C For Electrical Engineering (EE 204) course and its Laboratory Sections.

This repo also shows C programming topics that I learned and implemented without any problem. 

If you are technical staff to hire me, you can get a little bit idea of my C programming skills. Moreover, I do not open to public all of my codes, of course. Thanks.
